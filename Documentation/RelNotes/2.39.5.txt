Git 2.39.5 Release Notes
========================

Relative to Git 2.39.5, this release has fixes for regressions that
were introduced in 2.39.4, most notably the error message shown when
cloning Git LFS-enabled repositories. It also contains a fix for the
`osx-gcc` CI job.

Fixes since Git 2.39.4
----------------------

 * Some clone protections introduced in v2.39.4 broke Git LFS-enabled
   clones and have therefore been dropped.

 * The `core.hooksPath` setting is allowed in repository-local
   configs again; The benefits of making it protected were
   outweighed by the cost.

 * Fix a memory leak.

 * CI fix.

 * Adjust to newer Term::ReadLine to prevent it from breaking
   the interactive prompt code in send-email.
   (merge c016726c2d jk/send-email-with-new-readline later to maint).
