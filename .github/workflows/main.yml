# If more than one workflow run is triggered for the very same commit hash
# (which happens when multiple branches pointing to the same commit), only
# the first one is allowed to run, the second will be kept in the "queued"
# state. This allows a successful completion of the first run to be reused
# in the second run via the `skip-if-redundant` logic in the `config` job.
#
# The only caveat is that if a workflow run is triggered for the same commit
# hash that another run is already being held, that latter run will be
# canceled. For more details about the `concurrency` attribute, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency
